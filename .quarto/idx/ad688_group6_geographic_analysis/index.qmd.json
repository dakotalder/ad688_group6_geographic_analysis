As businesses adopt AI-driven tools and automation, demand for data science, machine learning, and software roles continues to grow, while routine administrative and operational jobs decline (Kahn et al, 2024). This recent shift has created a new geography of employment, where technological infrastructure and remote work options play central roles.\n\nRemote work, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and continued by companies adoption of this practice, has ereated more high-wage, skill-based positions. However, the benefits of this expansion are unevenly distributed as we will see in our analysis. Traditional technology hubs such as Silicon Valley, Austin, and Boston continue to hire a high number of tech/AI affected roles, while smaller metro areas and rural communities face challenges in attracting and retaining AI-related talent (Sheffi, 2024). At the same time, our data shows that remote and hybrid work models are allowing some decentralization, offering emerging regions new opportunities for growth.\n\nThis research analyzes how AI roles and other non-AI roles may be affected by geographic and remote work trends in 2025. The study investigates which states and urban areas demonstrate the highest job growth in AI versus non-AI careers, whether remote positions are increasing across industries, and how urban and rural job markets differ in AI accessibility. Based on our research, it is expected that AI roles will remain concentrated in tech-oriented regions, but it also seems that other non traditional metro areas may be seeing growth not previously seen. Also, remote work is anticipated to remain more prevalent in AI and technology fields, as well as higher salaries in both AI related jobs and remote jobs (Solo et al., 2025). Below are the main focal points of our research:\n\n\n## AI vs. Non-AI Job Growth\n\nPreliminary findings indicate that AI-related positions are growing in states such as Hawaii, Wyoming, and Montana. In contrast, non-AI jobs remain more evenly distributed, with steady growth across states with large service or manufacturing economies.\n\n![AI vs. Non-AI Job Growth - State](../ad688_group6_geographic_analysis/images/top10state.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"80%\"}\n\n![AI vs. Non-AI Job Growth - City](../ad688_group6_geographic_analysis/images/top10city.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"80%\"}\n\n## Trends in Remote Work Across Industries\n\nRemote job listings continue to represent a significant share of AI-related careers, especially in Finance and Insurance and Information Industries.

The data suggests that this is mostly due to high populations, so a deeper dive into industry would help in showing emerging markets outside of traditional tech hubs.\n\n![Top 15 Tech Hubs](../ad688_group6_geographic_analysis/images/top15techhubs.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"80%\"}\n\n## Urban vs. Rural Dynamics\n\nUrban regions continue to host the majority of AI employment due to their access to universities, data infrastructure, and venture capital.
