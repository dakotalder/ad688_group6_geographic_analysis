However, there seems to be no AI Job growth in multiple states, and an increase in Non-AI jobs in those same states, suggesting that AI isn’t quite yet displacing jobs. In fact, there are only a select few states where AI Jobs are increasing, most of the 50 states have an increase in Non-AI jobs."

This seems to suggest that more tech heavy industries can support and are seeing growth in remote positions, but industries like Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services are actually seeing a decline in remote work. These industries might have job titles that require in person work and assistance, which would lead to on-site."

There are plenty of high population, metro areas that will have plenty of jobs. We would like to go further and look at industry and AI jobs as well, which is found in the next plot."

    "text": "Artificial intelligence, also known as AI, is redefining the labor market, shaping not only how work is done but also where work is done. As businesses adopt AI-driven tools and automation, demand for data science, machine learning, and software roles continues to grow, while routine administrative and operational jobs decline (Kahn et al, 2024). This recent shift has created a new geography of employment, where technological infrastructure and remote work options play central roles.\nRemote work, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and continued by companies adoption of this practice, has ereated more high-wage, skill-based positions. However, the benefits of this expansion are unevenly distributed as we will see in our analysis. Traditional technology hubs such as Silicon Valley, Austin, and Boston continue to hire a high number of tech/AI affected roles, while smaller metro areas and rural communities face challenges in attracting and retaining AI-related talent (Sheffi, 2024). At the same time, our data shows that remote and hybrid work models are allowing some decentralization, offering emerging regions new opportunities for growth.\nThis research analyzes how AI roles and other non-AI roles may be affected by geographic and remote work trends in 2025. The study investigates which states and urban areas demonstrate the highest job growth in AI versus non-AI careers, whether remote positions are increasing across industries, and how urban and rural job markets differ in AI accessibility. Based on our research, it is expected that AI roles will remain concentrated in tech-oriented regions, but it also seems that other non traditional metro areas may be seeing growth not previously seen. Also, remote work is anticipated to remain more prevalent in AI and technology fields, as well as higher salaries in both AI related jobs and remote jobs (Solo et al., 2025). Below are the main focal points of our research:\n\n\nPreliminary findings indicate that AI-related positions are growing in states such as Hawaii, Wyoming, and Montana. In contrast, non-AI jobs remain more evenly distributed, with steady growth across states with large service or manufacturing economies.\n\n\n\nAI vs. Non-AI Job Growth - State\n\n\n\n\n\nAI vs. Non-AI Job Growth - City\n\n\n\n\n\nRemote job listings continue to represent a significant share of AI-related careers, especially in Finance and Insurance and Information Industries. Conversely, manufacturing and professional and technical services remain predominantly on-site.\n\n\n\nRemote Work Trends\n\n\n\n\n\nOur data shows that job postings are the highest in the New York, Washington DC, Dallas, and Chicago metro areas, while the traditional tech hubs like Boston, the Bay Area, and Austin actually aren’t at the top of job postings anymore. The data suggests that this is mostly due to high populations, so a deeper dive into industry would help in showing emerging markets outside of traditional tech hubs.\n\n\n\nTop 15 Tech Hubs\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban regions continue to host the majority of AI employment due to their access to universities, data infrastructure, and venture capital. However, remote work options are beginning to bridge the urban-rural divide, allowing rural professionals to participate in digital industries without relocating. Rural job markets, while smaller, show almost exact proportions of AI and Non-AI postings, reflecting that AI jobs as a whole don’t necessarily require specific locations.\n\n\n\nUrban and Rural AI Makeup\n\n\n\n\nKhan, A., Shad, F., Sethi, S., & Bibi, M.

    "text": "2.1 Key Insights\nOut of the 4 clusters, it seems like there are 3 fairly clear clusters and 1 that is more ambiguous.\nCluster 0: The ambiguous one, doesn’t seem to have any groupings along AI, Non-AI, and Salary.\nCluster 1: This is a group of higher salary paid positions, but are grouped regardless of AI vs Non-AI.\nCluster 2: These seem to be low paying, AI jobs.\nCluster 3: These seem to be low paying Non-AI jobs.\nIndustry Relationship:\nIt seems that the industries don’t have as much of a bearing on each cluster. For example, we thought that the high paying clusters would be more tech industry focused, but the low paying cluster also has a large amount of job openings in the same industries. This may mean that salaries are most likely influenced less by Industry and AI impact and influenced more by Skills, seniority, and education."

Like previously stated, things like seniority, education, and skills may be better predictors to higher or lower salaries.\nAnother insight that might be able to be used by a job seeker might be the highest and negative influencers on salary. Even though our model isn’t great, it seems that we can deduce that seeking a job in Washington might yield a higher salary vs. the baseline salary, but seeking a job in New Mexico might yield a lower salary than the baseline."
